I live in downtown Eugene.

* board of directors of Eugene Neighborhoods Inc
* I am not representing either of those organizations

Here's a Google Earth view of - roughly - Oregon.

You might be able to see a little red blip, near the left,
just above the middle.

And if we zoom in to the Willamette Valley...

OK, this is *in* Eugene, but it's not all of Eugene.

----------------
Oh! It's Downtown.

downtown
-------------------
Or rather, some discrete elements of downtownh

---------------------------------------------
It's parking.

downtown-with-borders
-------------------
This map is my attempt to map the footprint of land devoted exclusively
to parking in Downtown Eugene.

It's a lot!

obects
------
713 parking places

365 acres

25%

downtown-with-borders
---------------------

I think that percentage is probably artificially low,
because if you look along the north eastern corner,
I think that most of this shouldn't really be thought of as downtown.

You can see I missed some... this is a work in progress.

downtown-with-borders
---------------------

So. 25% of downtown, 91 acres.
* Is this interesting?
* Should you be interested?
* Is it a lot?

I'm going to start with the last question:
No, it's not a lot. There are downtowns with 40% devoted to parking.

Yes, it's a lot. That's 91 acres of the most valuable and potentially most
productive real estate in the city.

And that, I think, starts to answer the first two questions.

I started this project not really knowing where it was going.
I was walking or biking through downtown, and parts of it looked really nice
to me, really welcoming and vibrant

and parts of it not so much

5th-street-market-lot
---------------------

and I kept having opinions on land use... based on my feelings about what
it's like walking around.

I kept turning corners and thinking - wow, another parking lot.
How many are there?

downtown-with-borders
---------------------

So I started mapping it. 
I think this was about 40 hours work over two months.

And I reached a point where I think I got most of it.

now what? I guess I'm going to present it to people. 

Maybe I should know what I'm talking about. 
I did some reading.
I looked up some tax data.

This is a really good book.

Let me give you the cliff notes version:

cheap fast good
----------------

Like many other technologies, parking has the constraint 
that you can have any two of "Cheap, Fast, or Good".

Cheap might even mean free.
Fast means you can find it quickly. You're not circling the block.
Good means it is directly where you want to go.

Street parking is theoretically "good" - except that a parking spot
takes up 18" or so, so two of them occupy the whole frontage of many 
businesses. They're in short supply. A city can balance the equation
here so that they are just expensive enough that there are always a 
few empty spots on a given block. It stays good and fast, but it is expensive.

garages are generally "fast". They're really only "good" if they are very
close to your destination.

And then there is the business parking lot. Parking lots are magic.
My bank has a parking lot! My grocery store has a parking lot! There is always
a spot. There is no price to me, other than they increased price of my banking
and groceries, which I bear whether I park or not. And it is right at my 
destination!

But there is a secret cost here. The geometry of parking cars is such
that you can't have enough parking for a high-volume business without 
surrounding the business with parking. And that pushes the places apart.

And with the parking largely on a per-business basis, you lose the
business-district effect. You can't park at the bank and then go get groceries,
because the bank will not store your car while you are spending money elsewhere.

You can't have that vibrancy.

Let's look at two pieces of property downtown.
They are on the same block, owned by the same tax payer,
and nearly identical in size.

The first one is a building. Off the Waffle is in here,
along with plenty of other businesses.
It was one point 7 different tax parcels,
so clearly some smaller buildings were torn down to make this one big one.
That's fine; cities change.

northeast
---------
We've got the lot number, the size, and the taxes paid in 2023.
Let's make sure to notice the tax rate per acre.

The next one is a parking lot.
It is still in 4 tax parcels from the pre-parking lot days.
We're going to list them individually
and then show the same calculation of tax rate per acre for the whole parking lot.

northwest
---------
The building is not generating 10 times the tax revenue as the parking lot.
It is generating almost 20 times as much.

is parking interesting?
-----------------------
I hope I have convinced you that parking is at least a bit interesting.

should you be interested?
-------------------------
I think so.
discussions: is there enough parking?

YES.
* is it priced correctly for the health of our city and our downtown? 
* is it in the right spot for the health of our city and our downtown?
* is it designed correctly for the health of our city and our downtown?

Read this book!
Start talking and thinking about:
* dynamic pricing for street parking
* how much space we are allocating to storing vehicles downtown
* let's admit the surface parking lots are blight.

Human pleasure is not a frivolity.


Do we want downtown to be...
